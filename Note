1. linear cut generation (there are also equality constraitns involved, the cut at the moment consiers =< only )
2. issues with the mip solver
3. sometimes the tactic returns null (propagate-ineqs), or false
4. if a formula is a conjunction and the tactic gives false then it is unsat, if tactic returns true then this constraint 
is not needed
5. check gurobi if unsat core generation is easier, think about cut, correctness
6. trading with gurobi other params
6. make program parametric
7. investigate if removing a single sat instance is a good idea
8. gurobi unsat core also shows which variable are in the core

9 collectConjConstraint causing stack overflow
10 check if the solution is a real integer solution


QUANTIFIER ELIMINATION
1. pre-processing creates some aux variables (remove_unconstr tactic)
2.Incorrect results (due to bv_extract translation): 
    DeltaTR_CP_RP_DIFF_QESMT_benchmark_conjunction_11.smt (wrong formula emitted)
    DeltaTR_RFRNC_OUT_QESMT_benchmark_conjunction_4.smt 
3. handling of ite operation
4. obtaining benchmarks




Everywhere
1. the handling of negative integers while generating maExpr
2. in  IG: blocking some models also has to take care of the index not only the original id (only block those )
